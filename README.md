# Cross-correlation-coefficient
To compute the cross-spectrum of two maps and return their cross-correlation coefficient

Input files: 2 maps to be cross-correlated; 1 weight map to be applied to the cross-correlation
Power spectrum estimator: Primarily with polspice; Optionally using ianafast
Output fits files: map1 auto-spectrum; map2 auto-spectrum; map1Xmap2 cross-spectrum; map1Xmap2 cross-correlation coefficient.
Optional output:
